                      <p>In using Google Analytics our Website employs the extension âanonymizeIpâ. In doing so, Google abbreviates and thereby anonymizes your IP address. Google uses this information to analyze your use of our Website, to compile reports for us on internet activity and to provide other services relating to our Website.
